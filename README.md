## ✔ What does Tower of Hanoi really mean? <hr>

           The Towers of Hanoi is an ancient mathematical puzzle played with three rods and N number  
           of disks. At the start, all the disks are in the leftmost stack, with the largest disk on  
           the bottom and the smallest on the top.  
<br>
<br>

## ✔ Objectives of the puzzle ... <hr><br>  

        The goal of the puzzle is to get all the disks over to the rightmost stack,  
    	  obeying the following three simple rules:
		  
                     1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
                     2. disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack. 
                     3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
